VET CLINIC

Neutral NPC -- Civilians, Cats, Birds, Vet nurse

Enemy -- Policeman (nearby in police car and donut shop, will spawn more for backup), Dogs (in cages or asleep, not a threat in this level)

Target -- Vet (walks between Vet clinic and his house out back. his wife also lingers in the back) (has a beer or wine at all times)

TO DO:

-- Car models

-- Dog models

-- added a "isRun" bool and input so the Player can run. Running increases moveSpeed, but will also draw attention to yourself

-- added "isArmed" for when the Player has drawn their weapon. holding a weapon draws attention to yourself. added "isAiming" for when the Player is aiming. aiming slows your movement and draws even more attention. added "fire1" functionality. Left clicking fires the Player's equipped weapon

-- added "sussLevel" to help AI detect the Player's shifty movement. Performing certain actions increases your suss multiplyer

-- added WeaponsBase.cs for making Weapons (such as guns) Scriptable Objects. Weapons have Name, maximum Ammo, Damage, Fire Rate and Reload time values

-- added rudimentary third person camera and movement using https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4HpC--2iowE

1.3

-- updated Weapon script with additional logic. Added Shooting and Reloading and Holstering/Unholstering logic. The Player presses "H" to holster or unholster their weapon. Left click shoots, or if the current weapon is holstered, unholsters the weapon.

-- Weapon script now interacts with Player in a number of ways. Eg, when shooting changes Player's status to shooting, etc. Status effects sus levels and will effect animations. 

-- Added WeaponType to WeaponsBase. WeaponType effects animations and suslevel. For example a handgun confers less attention than a large rifle.
